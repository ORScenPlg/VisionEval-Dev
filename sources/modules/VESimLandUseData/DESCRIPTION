Description: This package processes data from several sources to produce a
    dataset that is used to estimate several models for synthesizing Bzones and
    their likely land use attributes. Datasets from the U.S. Census 2015
    American Community Survey, EPA Smart Location Database (SLD), and National
    Transit Database (NTD) are combined to produce this dataset.
